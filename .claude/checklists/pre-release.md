# Pre-release checklist

Run this checklist top-to-bottom before pushing a `vX.Y.Z` git
tag and publishing the GitHub Release. Coordinated release train
per ADR-0015 — every workspace package bumps to the same minor
in lockstep.

## 1. Branch + state

- [ ] On `main`. Clean working tree (`git status`).
- [ ] Synced with `origin/main` (`git pull --ff-only`).
- [ ] Every feature PR for the target minor is merged. Open PRs
      either ship in this train or move to the next.

## 2. Version bump

- [ ] Every member of `[tool.uv.workspace.members]` has its
      `pyproject.toml` `[project] version` bumped to `X.Y.Z`.
- [ ] Root `pyproject.toml` (if it carries a version) is bumped.
- [ ] No pinned dep on `agentforge-core` (or any in-train
      package) is left at an earlier minor.

```bash
# One-shot check:
rg -n '^version = "' packages/*/pyproject.toml
```

## 3. Gate

- [ ] `uv sync` succeeds against the bumped versions.
- [ ] `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` is green
      (ruff format + ruff check + mypy --strict + bandit +
      pytest + ≥90 % coverage).
- [ ] CI on `main` is green for the commit being tagged.

## 4. CHANGELOG

- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` section has every notable
      change since the last tag. (Per Keep a Changelog v1.1
      under `Added` / `Changed` / `Deprecated` / `Removed` /
      `Fixed` / `Security`.)
- [ ] Rename `## [Unreleased]` → `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`.
- [ ] Append a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` section above it
      for the next cycle.
- [ ] Each entry references the canonical spec
      (`docs/features/feat-NNN-*.md`) or ADR where applicable.

## 5. Release notes

- [ ] Copy `.claude/templates/release-notes.md` to
      `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`.
- [ ] Fill **every** section. Highlights, breaking changes,
      coordinated release train table, cross-language status,
      shipped features, acknowledgements. The template's
      comments call out what each section needs.
- [ ] No placeholder text (`<feature title>`, `<…>`, etc.)
      remains.
- [ ] Migration guide present when there is any breaking change;
      "**None**" written out when there isn't.

## 6. Docs sync

- [ ] `docs/features/README.md` — every feature shipped in this
      train shows `shipped` (not `proposed`).
- [ ] Each shipped spec's metadata Status field reads
      `shipped (Python — <surface>)` (or equivalent).
- [ ] `docs/roadmap.md` Shipped table lists the new release row;
      Backlog reflects what slid to the next train.
- [ ] `README.md` install snippets pin the new version (if they
      pin at all).

## 7. State

- [ ] `.claude/state/current.md` `last_shipped` updated.
- [ ] `.claude/state/log.md` has a `## YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM —
      vX.Y.Z released` entry summarising what landed.

## 8. Tag + publish

- [ ] `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "AgentForge vX.Y.Z — <codename>"`.
- [ ] `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
- [ ] `gh release create vX.Y.Z --notes-file docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`.
- [ ] Verify the GitHub Release page renders the notes
      correctly; attach any binary artefacts if applicable.

## 9. Post-release

- [ ] PyPI: each workspace package built and uploaded
      (`uv build` + `twine upload` per package; or the
      automation that will replace this once CI publishing
      lands).
- [ ] Announcement drafted (README / discussions / blog).
- [ ] Bump the `[Unreleased]` section of CHANGELOG.md back to
      empty for the next cycle (covered in §4 — verify).
- [ ] Open a `chore/post-release-cleanup` PR if any drift was
      surfaced during the train (rare but possible).

## Cadence reference

Per ADR-0015:

- During 0.x — release train every 2 weeks.
- Patch releases (0.x.y → 0.x.(y+1)) between trains are bug
  fixes only.
- Breaking changes ship at minor bumps and **require** a
  migration guide in the release notes.
